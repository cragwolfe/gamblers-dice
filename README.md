> > The term Gambler's fallacy refers to a misconception about statistics. [...] In statistics, a random event has a certain probability of occurring. The fallacy is that if the event has occurred less frequently in the past, it will be more frequent in the future. -Wikipedia

> Well no longer is this a fallacy my friends, these dice are real! If you roll a 20 sided die, and you haven't seen a 20 in a while it is statistically more likely to show up in the next roll with these dice. And the best part, it's still uniformly random for large sample sets!
